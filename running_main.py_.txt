To run this code, I go to the folder where my main.py file is saved. Then, I open a terminal there and type:
uvicorn main:app --reload
This starts the FastAPI server. After that, I can open a browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to check the API, or http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to use the interactive API docs.
